ailwind CSS excels in customization and flexibility due to its utility-first approach,
allowing developers to create unique designs effortlessly. Bootstrap offers a more structured
and opinionated approach, which might not suit projects requiring extensive customization.

Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.[4][5]
